    errors:
      box_id_not_found: |-
        Parallels provider couldn't fetch the box image ID. This is usually because
        the "config.pvs" file is corrupted or doesn't exist. Please remove the box,
        re-add it, and try again.

        Box: "%{name}"
        Box VM config: "%{config}"

      box_image_not_found: |-
        Parallels VM image (*.pvm or *.macvm) could not be found in the directory of
        '%{name}' box. This is usually because the image has been removed manually.
        Please remove the box, re-add it, and try again.
      dhcp_leases_file_not_accessible: |-
        Parallels DHCP leases file is not accessible. The Parallels provider
        uses it to detect an IP address of virtual machine. This file must be
        readable for the user that is running Vagrant.

        Parallels DHCP leases file: %{leases_file}
      execution_error: |-
        There was an error while command execution. The command and stderr is shown below.

        Command: %{command}

      json_parse_error: |-
        Failed to parse the JSON string! Please report this as a bug of Parallels
        provider: https://github.com/Parallels/vagrant-parallels/issues
        JSON string is shown below:

        %{data}

      external_disk_not_found: |-
        External disk image could not be found. In case of linked clone it is
        usually because the parent VM image was removed. It means that the virtual
        disk is inconsistent, please remove it from the VM configuration.

        Disk image path: %{path}
      linux_prl_fs_invalid_options: |-
        Failed to mount folders in Linux guest. You've specified mount options
        which are not supported by "prl_fs" file system.

        Invalid mount options: %{options}
      network_collision: |-
        The specified host network collides with a non-hostonly network!
        This will cause your specified IP to be inaccessible. Please change
        the IP or name of your host only network so that it no longer matches that of
        a bridged or non-hostonly network.

        Host-only Network Address: '%{hostonly_netaddr}'
        Bridged Network '%{bridge_interface}': '%{bridge_netaddr}'

      mac_os_x_required: |-
        Parallels provider works only on macOS (Mac OS X) systems.
      parallels_install_incomplete: |-
        Parallels Desktop is complaining that the installation is incomplete.
        Try to reinstall Parallels Desktop or contact Parallels support.
      parallels_invalid_version: |-
        Vagrant could not fetch Parallels Desktop version from output:
          %{output}

        This is an internal error that should be reported as a bug.
      parallels_mount_failed: |-
        Vagrant was unable to mount Parallels Desktop shared folders. This is usually
        because the filesystem "prl_fs" is not available. This filesystem is
        made available via the Parallels Tools and kernel module.
        Please verify that these guest tools are properly installed in the
        guest. This is not a bug in Vagrant and is usually caused by a faulty
        Vagrant box. For context, the command attempted was:

        %{command}

        The error output from the command was:

        %{output}
      parallels_no_room_for_high_level_network: |-
        There is no available slots on the Parallels Desktop VM for the configured
        high-level network interfaces. "private_network" and "public_network"
        network configurations consume a single network adapter slot on the
        Parallels Desktop VM. Parallels Desktop limits the number of slots to 16, and it
        appears that every slot is in use. Please lower the number of used
        network adapters.
      parallels_not_detected: |-
        Vagrant could not detect Parallels Desktop Pro! Make sure it is properly installed.
        Vagrant uses the `prlctl` binary that only ships with Pro and Business
        editions of Parallels Desktop. If the one is installed, please make sure
        that the `prlctl` binary is available on the PATH environment variable.
      parallels_tools_iso_not_found: |-
        Parallels Tools ISO file does not exist. The Parallels provider uses it
        to install or update Parallels Tools in the guest machine. Try to
        reinstall Parallels Desktop.

        Expected ISO path: "%{iso_path}"
      parallels_vm_option_not_found: |-
        Could not find a required option of Parallels Desktop virtual machine:
          %{vm_option}
        This is an internal error that should be reported as a bug.
      parallels_unsupported_edition: |-
        Vagrant has detected that you have an edition of Parallels Desktop for Mac
        installed that is not supported. Vagrant Parallels provider is compatible
        only with Pro and Business editions of Parallels Desktop. Other editions
        do not have command line functionality and can not be used with Vagrant.

        Note: Starting since Parallels Desktop 11 for Mac, Vagrant Parallels
        provider can be only used with Pro or Business edition of Parallels
        Desktop for Mac. Please, be aware while choosing the edition to upgrade to.
      snapshot_id_not_detected: |-
        ID of the newly created shapshod could not be detected. This is an
        internal error that users should never see. Please report a bug to
        Parallels provider.

        stdout: %{stdout}
      snapshot_not_found: |-
        The 'linked_clone_snapshot' specified could not be found. Please double
        check and try again.

         Snapshot ID: %{snapshot}
      shared_interface_not_found: |-
        Shared network interface was not found in your virtual machine configuration.
        It is required for communications with VM and port forwarding. Please
        check network configuration in your Vagrantfile.
      shared_interface_disconnected: |-
        Your Mac host is not connected to Shared network. It is required for
        communications with VM and port forwarding. Please enable this option in GUI:

        Parallels Desktop -> Preferences -> Network -> Shared -> Connect Mac to this network

      vm_clone_failure: |-
        The VM cloning failed! Please ensure that the box you're using is not
        corrupted and try again.
      vm_name_exists: |-

      deprecate_power_consumption: |-
        Setting "optimize_power_consumption" has been deprecated in the Parallels
        provider and will be removed in the future releases. Power consumption
        is enabled by default. If you want to keep it enabled, then just remove
        this setting from your Vagrantfile. Otherwise, please replace it with
        this block in order to disable the power consumption:

          config.vm.provider "parallels" do |prl|
            prl.customize ["set", :id, "--longer-battery-life", "off"]

        vm_already_running: |-
          Parallels Desktop VM is already running.
      status:
        inaccessible: |-
          The VM is inaccessible! This is a rare case which means that Parallels
          Desktop can't find your VM configuration. This usually happens when deleting
          the VM via Parallels Desktop GUI, moving to a new computer, etc.
          Please consult Vagrant Parallels provider for how to handle this issue.
        not_created: |-
          The environment has not yet been created. Run `vagrant up` to
          create the environment. If a machine is not created, only the
          default provider will be shown. So if a provider is not listed,
          then the machine is not created for that environment.
        paused: |-
          The VM is paused. This VM may have been paused via Parallels Desktop
          GUI or the `prlctl` command line interface. To unpause, please
          use the Parallels Desktop GUI and/or `prlctl` command line interface
          so that vagrant would be able to control the VM again.
        suspended: |-
          The VM is suspended. To resume this VM you can run `vagrant resume`
          or `vagrant up` to restart it again, so that vagrant would be able
          to control the VM again.
        stopped: |-
          The VM is stopped. To start the VM, simply run `vagrant up`
        running: |-
          The VM is running. To stop this VM, you can run `vagrant halt` to
          shut it down forcefully, or you can run `vagrant suspend` to simply
          suspend the virtual machine. In either case, to restart it again,
          simply run `vagrant up`.
